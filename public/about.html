<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Rithanya aka Rithu. Iam a bit boring person , gets super irritated real quick. I would say im pessimistic and often unconfident.</p>

<p>okay , now let me describe what i like . I like to eat a lot , sing my heart out , sometimes dance too. Once in a while i paint or draw something. I write very rarerly. If i write , either i'm too disheartened or overwhelmed. I jotted down a poem -'wednesday morning' when i was too lonely ,depressed and felt over burdened.  </p>

<p>I want to go on a long vacation. With zero overthinking or fear of future.  I want to forget everything for a while. I want a pause. I want to walk barefoot on greeny grass, slip my hand into the ocean water , touch the clouds . I want to relax . I want to forget the busy world , just for a while... </p>
